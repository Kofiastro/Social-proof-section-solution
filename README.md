## My process
Using Tailwindcss i have been able to work on designs much faster and i want to learn more by working on more projects at frontendmentor to help me be good at it.

### Built with

### What I learned

Third Project using TailwindCSS.So far so good.I was faced with one big issue regarding setting the cards and making sure the text falls apart from each other. .I was able to figure it out using justify between in the card container.The code below was one important key thing i was able to identify.
